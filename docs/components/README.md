# Introduction

Vue2Leaflet is a wrapper library for the mapping library [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)

To easily encapsulate most of the functionality of Leaflet a series of composable vue-components are provided.

::: tip
Most of our components do not emit events
but **all** the components pass down listeners for Leaflet's events.
It's possible to bind to them by simply writing `@leafletEventName`
:::

::: tip
Most components accept an `options` object, which will be passed to
the constructor of the underlying Leaflet object. Use this to set any
options that are not explicitly implemented as reactive Vue `props` on
the component.

**Note:** Leaflet often does not provide a mechanism for updating many
of these options after creating a map element. For this reason, changes
made to this `options` object are not reactive.
